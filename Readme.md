# Presidential Documents Ngram Viewer

## Purpose
To discover word usage frequencies by US presidents over time across 118,561 official documents and transcripts. Answers questions such as:
- What does word usage by US presidents look like over time?
- Who said it first? Last? Most?
- Where was it said?
- When was it said?
- Can I preview the documents it was said in?

## Data
The primary data source was The American Presidency Project at https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/. I wrote a web scraper in R to capture all 118,561 official documents and associated metadata including:
- Date
- Location
- Categories
- President
- Citation
- Document uri
- Word count

Corpus data totaled 117,374,146 words, which was then tokenized using Quanteda to produce a SQLite database of 7,069,561 n-grams.

This project gathered n-grams 1:5, meaning single words up to 5 word pairs. Leveraged Sqlite’s FST4 extension for full-text search for faster text parsing and to generate the snippets (pictured below).
